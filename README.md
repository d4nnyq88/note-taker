# note-taker

The Note Taker project is a JavaScript, Node.js, and Express focused project requiring the use of the GET and POST requests, routing, JSON, Middleware and static assets. I used the Express and Path modules along with the Router class to build the connections in the backend of the app. The application is initialized in node using the command "node server.js". The app has been deployed on Heroku at https://mysterious-eyrie-29837.herokuapp.com/. Users are able to click the Get Started button to navigate to the /notes page. On the /notes page, users can add new notes, select  existings note, or delete notes. All saved notes remain on the app until deleted.
